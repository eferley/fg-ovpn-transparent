# A "transparent" OpenVPN for Fantasy Grounds

This document will describe a solution for GMs \(Game Masters\) to publish their virtual table through an ad-hoc VPN hosted on AWS \(Amazon Web Services\).

## When do you need a VPN for FG ?

**Most GMs do not need to use a VPN** to successfully open thair virtual table for players.

But there are situations where **a VPN may be needed** :

1. **temporary connection from a "public" internet facility** \(hotel room, etc\)
2. country/ISP setup makes **unique public IPv4 address unavailable**
3. **proper port forwarding rule not possible** for one \(or more\) routers

## What is the problem ?
