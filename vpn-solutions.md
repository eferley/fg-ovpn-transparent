# VPN solutions

{% hint style="success" %}
Thankfully, if you find yourself in a NO-GO situation, and **as long as your can establish outgoing connections** to the Internet, **you should be able to use some kind of VPN-based solution**.
{% endhint %}

There are **multiple commercial offers for VPN services** available nowadays.

Many of them are targetted at : either hiding your own public IP address, or gaining full access to the Internet in countries where the government imposes harsh restrictions.

Others provide one or multiple kinds of "real" VPNs functionnality like "closed VPNs".

**Some of them** \(like [Hamachi](https://www.vpn.net/), which is well knwown in the gaming sphere\) **provide a free tier**.

{% hint style="info" %}
I have not actively tested commercial VPN offers other than Hamachi.

Hamachi is a very neat solution for "closed VPNs" with multiple options for network setup and it supports mobile platforms.

Their free tier is very good and quite sufficient for FG-like requirements \(you can host 4 players in a free VPN and create multiple VPNs simultaneously for more players if needed\).
{% endhint %}

## "Closed" VPNs

Some offers \(like the free Hamachi offer\) enable setting up a "closed VPN" where **only members of the VPN created by the GM are able to connect** to the GM's machine \(or to each other, depending on the networking options you choose\).

{% hint style="info" %}
"Closed VPNs" are actually what VPN technology was initially designed for.
{% endhint %}

My personnal preference, both as a GM and as a player, is to avoid using that kind of offer, because :

* **it implies that all players install the same VPN software and setup their access to the specific game or GM VPN**
* _for Hamachi specifically_ : it maintains a permanent set of networking parameters in my machine, even when not in active use, that sometimes interfere with my own \(rather complex\) network settings: i am often connected to 2 or 3 other VPNs at a time for work, and my laptop also supports local networks for virtual machines at the same time
* I have my own VPN servers ðŸ¤£ 

But **closed VPNs are a very valid option for a GM**, and have some advantages :

* you can select what players will be able to access your game by including / excluding people from your own VPN\(s\)
* with some "network topologies" \(like the Hamachi "hub-and-spoke"\) you can maintain network isolation between players, enabling them to reach only the "hub" \(your GM FG machine\)
