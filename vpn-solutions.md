# VPN solutions

{% hint style="success" %}
Thankfully, if you find yourself in a NO-GO situation, and **as long as your can establish outgoing connections** to the Internet, **you should be able to use some kind of VPN-based solution**.
{% endhint %}

There are **multiple commercial offers for VPN services** available nowadays.

Most of them \(but not all\) are targetted at either hiding your own public IP address, or being able to benefit from a full access to the Internet in countries where the government imposes harsh restrictions.

**Some of them** \(like [Hamachi](https://www.vpn.net/), which is well knwown in the gaming sphere\) **provide a free tier**.

## "Closed" VPNs

Some offers \(like the free Hamachi offer\) enable setting up a "closed VPN" where **only members of the same VPN** as this created by the GM are able to connect to the GM's machine.

My personnal preference as a GM is to avoid using that kind of offer, because :

* it implies that all players install the same VPN software and setup their access to the game/GM VPN
* _for Hamachi specifically_: it maintains a permanent set of networking parameters, even when not in active use, that sometimes interfere with my own settings \(i am usually connected to 2 or 3 VPNs, just for work\)
