# Lifting the "1 GM at-a-time" restriction

What if you have **multiple GMs that need the VPN to host games** ? For example, you may belong to a community of Fantasy Grounds players and GMs mostly based in "pure IPv6" countries.

There are several ways to manage such situations, that we'll explore below :

* **1-at-a-time /N :** _**Time-sharing**_ a single VPN Server + single GM connection/certificate
* **Nx 1-at-a-time :** Each GM creates his _**own VPN server**_ following this guide
* **N-at-a-time :** Single VPN Server + Nx _**GM-dedicated connections/certificates**_

{% hint style="info" %}
**Shared installations will preferably run 24x7**, to avoid requiring the server owner availability \(for start/stop or launch/terminate actions\)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Remember that [**each GM has to check his/her own machine**](../general/gms-machine-barriers.md) for "Barriers 1 to 3"
{% endhint %}



## **1-at-a-time /N :** _**Time-sharing**_ a single VPN Server + single GM connection/certificate

You share with other GMs the hard work you have already done following this guide :

* you distribute [the same set of OpenVPN parameters and credentials](../local-setup/step-3-prepare-your-openvpn-connection.md#my-fg-ovpn-dm01) to all you GM friends
* each of them [installs OpenVPN client](../local-setup/step-1-install-openvpn-+-easy-rsa-2.md) _**NB:** They do **NOT** need to install EasyRSA2 or setup a PKI, **only OpenVPN itself is required**_
* each of them [installs the set of parameters](../local-setup/step-3-prepare-your-openvpn-connection.md#openvpn-gui) that you supplied

üëç **Pros :**

* lightweight solution
* no technical skills required for other GMs

üëé **Cons :**

* **STILL 1-AT-A-TIME !**
* replacing the certificate requires installing the new set of parameters for all GMs
* **your own availability**, required to start/launch the server and communicate the new Public IP **if it only runs on-demand**, as opposed to 24x7
* **time-sharing organization**, usage planning and timezone errors, colliding time slots - **2 GMs connected at the same time =&gt; broken FG sessions** - one day or another you'll encounter issues like those :

## **Nx 1-at-a-time :**  Each GM creates his own VPN server

This option is self-explanatory...

The main issue here is that some \(most ?\) of the **other GMs may not be as geeky as you are** \(since you made it this far...üòâ\), and **may be daunted by this solution**.

üëç **Pros :**

* maximum flexibility

üëé **Cons :**

* maximum setup work
* technical skills required for GMs



## **N-at-a-time :** Single VPN Server + Nx _**GM-dedicated connections/certificates**_

This option is quite neat as it enables several GMs to **run multiple simultaneous FG games \(N at a time\)** **through the one and only VPN Server** you already created, but :

{% hint style="warning" %}
* It requires **additional work to setup**
* It is **not 100% transparent for players.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**It is mostly suitable for a community with several GMs, running mid- to long-term FGC games \(campaigns\)** since the extra complexity is managed up-front, once and for all.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To support multiple concurrent games going through our small VPN server, which has **only ONE Public IP**, we'll use a **different communication port for each GM**.
{% endhint %}

This solution **extends our current setup** by :

* creating **individual GM certificates** in our PKI
* transparently forwarding FG traffic to and from each **specific GM** for **a specific FG port**

üëç **Pros :**

* **removes the burden of time-sharing organization** The GMs with dedicated connections can _host FGC games **at any time**_ \(while the VPN server is running\) _**without fear of collision**_ with other games.  They can even forget to close their VPN connection...
* **compatible with the original "1-at-a-time" setup, which remains 100% transparent for players** You can have both : GM-dedicated specific connections **and** time-shared setup you already created
* **gives more control over security** by having specific connections/certificates per GM

üëé **Cons :**

* it needs you to **dive deeper into the OpenVPN server configuration** We'll detail this with step-by-step instructions in next pages
* it requires **GMs and Players** to create and use a **customized shortcut to FGC** \(for ease of use\) to run Fantasy Grounds Classic on a specific TCP port, different than the standard TCP 1802 Creating a specific shortcut to the FG program _should not be an issue_ to play with a specific GM for multiple sessions in an _on-going campaign_; but it could be _awkward for 1-shot games_

_This solution became possible when I finally understood how to run FG Classic on a custom TCP port...  
It **only** took me a bit more than 2 years after starting using the program, to find this info !..._
