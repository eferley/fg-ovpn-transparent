# Introduction

## What is the problem ?

{% hint style="info" %}
**For a GM, the FG program needs to be reachable from the players on this port : TCP 1802**
{% endhint %}

As a Game Master, hosting on game on a virtual table implies that the table \(= actually the FG program\) has to be reachable from the players' FG programs running on distant computers.
