# Introduction

## When do you need a VPN for FG ?

**Most GMs do not need to use a VPN** to successfully open thair virtual table for players.

But there are situations where **a VPN may be needed** :

1. **temporary connection from a "public" internet facility** \(hotel room, etc\)
2. country/ISP setup makes **unique public IPv4 address unavailable**
3. **proper port forwarding rule not possible** for one \(or more\) routers

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
