# Introduction - F.G.Comms

## Fantasy Grounds \("Classic"\) communications

_This document focuses on FG "Classic"_ \(as opposed to the future release of FG "Unity", currently planned for the end of 2019\).

The current release of FG \("Classic"\) as of this writing is v3.3.7 \(for the "Live" branch, v3.3.8 for the "Test" branch\), but **all versions of FG "Classic" should work in the same way**.

{% hint style="info" %}
As a Game Master, **hosting a virtual table** implies that the table \(= actually the FG program\) has to be **reachable from the the players**' FG programs running on distant computers.

Fantasy Grounds \("Classic"\) uses **TCP port 1802 on IPv4** for communications between the GM and player Fantasy Grounds instances.
{% endhint %}

So, to join a GM's virtual table, **a player's FG only has to know/find the GM's IP address** where it will be able to connect to \(on the TCP 1802 port\).

The IP\(v4\) address used will be one of :

1. the **GM's "public IP"** address for players connecting **through the Internet**
2.  the **GM's "private IP"** address for players located **in the same local network**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be aware of the above **distinct requirements for player connection from the Internet / from the in-house network** \(same ethernet LAN or wireless access point\).
{% endhint %}

## What can go wrong ?

There are multiple points where security features or technical niceties may prevent incoming connections from players to your GM FG program.

Network setup combinations are infinite; in this docment we focus on the usual "home" network with a single "Internet router" \(or a cascade of 2 devices\) connecting all your personnal devices to the Internet \(PC/Mac, Phone, Tablet, SmartTV,...\).

So let's have a quick look at the barriers between your players and your shiny new virtual table, starting from your own "GM Fantasy Grounds" outwards; with "Barrier 4" we'll go into the "**Port Forwarding**" subject many GMs are afraid of.

Then we'll talk about some no-go situations that relate to the last 2 barriers and are "out of reach" for the GM.

And finally we'll introduce VPN solutions and more specifically the non-intrusive "transparent" setup we present in the rest of this document, and how it enables a GM to overcome these barriers.

{% hint style="info" %}
The following can also be used as a reminder / check-list for every GM out there...
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
You can **test the first 3 "barriers" locally with 2** _**different**_ **machines** : one being the GM sharing the virtual table, and the other acting as a "local" player : a player on a _different machine than the GM's, but connected to the same \(W\)LAN._

A demo version of FG on the second machine is ok for this kind of test.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a test "Player" FG on a second machine in your local network is unable to connect to your "GM" FG, then first clear the first 3 barriers, because each of these is also a show stopper for remote player connections.
{% endhint %}

## VPN solutions üôå 

Thankfully, as long as your can establish outgoing connections to the Internet, you should be able to use some kind of VPN-based solution.

There are multiple commercial offers for VPN services available nowadays.

Most of them are targetted at either hiding your own public IP address, or being able to benefit from a full access to the Internet in countries where the government imposes harsh restrictions.

Some offers \(like [Hamachi](https://www.vpn.net/) which is well knwown in the gaming sphere\) enable setting up up "closed VPN" where only members of the same VPN as this created by the GM are able to connect to the GM.

My personnal preference as a GM is to avoid using that kind of offer, because it implies that all players install the same VPN software and setup their access to the game/GM VPN
