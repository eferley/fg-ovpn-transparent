# FGU vs. FGC networking

## MAJOR Difference \#1: Cloud Mode

* **FGC**: GM FGC= server, players FGC = clients
* **FGU in "LAN mode"**: \(like FGC\) GM FGU = server, players FGU = clients
* **FGU in "Cloud Mode"**: GM+Players FGU = clients, server = cloud infrastructure

With **FGU in Cloud mode** :

Everyone \(GM+players\) is a client, using outgoing connections to the cloud server infrastructure and there is no requirement to accept incoming connections on the GM's machine at the network transport layer \(with the delicate/dreaded NAT boundary crossing\).

{% hint style="success" %}
**There is no need for \(static\) port forwarding or VPN**  for **FGU in Cloud mode** üôå 
{% endhint %}

However it does add a dependency on the availability and reachability of the Unity cloud platform from the GM and the players...which is generally ok ! ..._except for the rare case when it isn't..._

_Also, Unity networking is IPv6-aware, but we won't_ ~~_open that can of worms_~~ _explore this aspect...it is sufficient to tell that it should work with "all" Internet Access Providers around Ze world..._

{% hint style="success" %}
With FGU networking, SmiteWorks has reached **a great turning point for the ease of use of Fantasy Grounds,** for an overwhelming majority of users ! üëè 

...and of course let's not forget the **native support of Mac/Linux platforms**...and **LOS**...and...
{% endhint %}

_Let's hope that within a few years, when FGU remains the only version of FG in use, this blurb will have reached a great turning point towards being totally useless !_ üòÇ _Unfortunately for now experience shows there are  still a number of situations where it can help._

## Difference \#2: UDP vs TCP

* **FGC** uses the **TCP** protocol
* **FGU** uses the **UDP** protocol

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is also true for **FGU in LAN mode** =&gt; we'll have to **adapt firewall & port forwarding rules** to take UDP into account for that use case
{% endhint %}

## **Difference \#3 : Port number selection**

* **FGU Cloud mode** : not relevant
* **FGU LAN mode** : entry box **available on screen** in launcher, **persisted** to connections history
* **FGC**: **command-line flag** required for non-default port, **when starting FGC "launcher"**

###  For FGU - Cloud mode

**You don't \(need to\) select a specific port**, since the connection to Unity platform is dynamically auto-negociating this for you \(**both for the GM and for the players**\) - just like when your browser connects to a web site.

In **Cloud mode**, all the plumbing between the GM and the players is handled within the Unity cloud server infrastructure \(of which the GM FGU and the players FGU are clients\), and **the UDP port entry box on GM FGU launcher screen is NOT taken into account** \(in the following example, the Cloud-mode game will **not** use UDP 1805\) :

_**NB:** The only difference between "public" and "private" games in Cloud mode is that players will directly see all public games listed in the lobby, while they need to know the GM name to connect to private games.  Both public and private games can be protected by a password._

After a player has successfully connected, the **players' connection history persists relevant information** to easily reconnect for the next session \(the password stays hidden\) :

### For FGU - LAN mode

The **GM FGU** is a server, listening to the **port number** you enter on the **lauch screen \(UDP\) port entry box** \(default = UDP 1802\).  The following example shows an FGU game run in LAN mode on non-default port UDP 1805 :

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28194%29.png)

_**NB:** LAN-mode games are not listed in the lobby._

The **players FGU** are clients, connecting directly to the GM FGU using its **public IP address \(or DNS name\)** and **UDP port** \(default = UDP 1802\), entered in the relevant **entry boxes** :

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28186%29.png)

After a player has successfully connected to a specific LAN-mode game, the **connection history will also persist all relevant information** to reconnect for the next session, including the specific UDP port :

### For FG "Classic"

FG "Classic" works roughly in the same way \(on TCP\) as FGU-LAN mode \(on UDP\) :

* the **GM FGC** is a server =&gt; has to **listen to incoming connections on a specific port**
* the players FGC are clients, using direct outgoing connections to the GM FGC public IP

_FG\(C\) features the "Server Alias" system, which works reasonably well to both hide the public IP address of the GM, and stay persistent when the GM public IP changes - but it does not mandatorily work for edge-case network situations \(especially VPNs\)._

**FGC has NO entry box to select a TCP port on the launch screen, either for the GM or players**.  It also cannot persist a specific TCP port in the player's connection history.

But **FGC supports a "command-line flag" to specify a TCP port when running the FG launcher** : **-p**_**NNNN**_
