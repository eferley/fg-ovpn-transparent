## CoC

**Call of Cthulhu** : a well known RPG

## D&D

Many models of "Internet routers" support auto-updating DDNS services.

## DNS

**Domain Name System** : the way machines are named in the Internet

See also : **FQDN**

* **Fantasy Grounds "Classic"** : the current major version of FG \(v3.x\)

## FGU
