# Step 4 : Configure your AWS environment -WIP

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you have not already done so, here comes the time for you to follow that [account creation process info](../proposed-solution/amazon-web-services.md#how-to-create-an-aws-account), and especially take a few minutes to **watch the small video linked there, including the part for creating your first IAM user** \(**IAM** = Identity & Access Management\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Create your first IAM user as an administrator** ASAP as it will enable you to avoid using your "root account".
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**PLEASE ! Create an administrative IAM user for yourself** in your new AWS account and **after that avoid using your "root account"** to manage your AWS environment.

That's an "AWS best practice" for a reason...
{% endhint %}

There are _**hundreds of videos and articles all over the Internet**_ about that "_create aws account_" topic, so feel free to watch and compare...just beware to select recent enough ones \( &lt; 1 year old is usually ok\).



_**I'll now wait for you to come back with your shiny admin login to this brand new AWS account....**_
