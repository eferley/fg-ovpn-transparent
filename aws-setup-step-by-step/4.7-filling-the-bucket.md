# 4.7-Filling the bucket - WIP

We'll need a specific hierarchy of folders and files in our S3 bucket, so that the bootstrap script \(enabling our OpenVPN server auto-configuration at startup\) find all the required elements to do its job.

**We'll first prepare this entire hierarchy locally, so that we can :**

* **easily check/edit/recheck** our file contents and the names of all files and sub-folders
* use both transfer options :
  * **manually transfer** our files with AWS S3 console
  * **use batch transfer/synching tools** like [CloudBerry Explorer for Amazon S3](../proposed-solution/tools.md#cloudberry-explorer-for-amazon-s3-free-version)

## Building the hierarchy locally

We'll create a hierarchy of folders able to "host" our own current setup, and also several similar parallel setups if needed.

Do you remember the my-fg-ovpn-s3 sub-folder we created long ago ? That's what we'll use it for.

We'll begin by 2 folders at the top level : **`deploy`** and **`userdata`**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

### userdata NEEDS your input !

This folder will contain **one file for each "configuration name"** that has an auto-configuration script : our own _**`my-fg-ovpn`**_ will shortly have one, so we'll give it a UserData file we'll see a bit further.

Our UserData files will be named 

This type of file is in fact a set of shell commands executed by AWS EC2 "Instance" \(=a virtual server\) when it  boots for the first time.

So these files are like mini-shell scripts and we'll call them **`"configuration name"-userdata.sh`**

Let's look at the beginning of a sample file :

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You will NEED to customize the values at lines 4 to 6 according to your own choices**
{% endhint %}

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="sample-conf-name-userdata.sh !! PARTIAL !!" %}
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo `date` "UserData script starting - Args : $@"

export MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME=your-configuration-name
export MY_STARTUP_S3_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket-name
export MY_STARTUP_VPNSubNet=10.10.10.0/24

```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**We have 2 \(or 3\) values that have to reflect the choices you made earlier :**

* **at line 4** you need to give **YOUR chosen "configuration name"**
* **at line 5** you need to give **the exact name of YOUR S3 bucket**
* **at line 6** you see the **VPN Private IP network**
{% endhint %}

\*\*\*\*







So, for our my-fg-ovpn demo, the block above so that it looks like :

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="my-fg-ovpn-userdata.sh - !! PARTIAL !!" %}
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo `date` "UserData script starting - Args : $@"

export MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME=your-configuration-name
export MY_STARTUP_S3_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket-name
export MY_STARTUP_VPNSubNet=10.10.10.0/24

```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}



#### Sample userdata file

Here is the **complete UserData file for a configuration called "sample-conf-name"**, that you will **copy/paste and rename+edit \(lines 4-6\)** so that it matches your own choices/requirements :

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="sample-conf-name-userdata.sh" %}
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo `date` "UserData script starting - Args : $@"

export MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME=your-configuration-name
export MY_STARTUP_S3_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket-name
export MY_STARTUP_VPNSubNet=10.10.10.0/24

export MY_STARTUP_S3_DEPLOY_URL=s3://${MY_STARTUP_S3_BUCKET}/deploy

echo `date` "MY_FGVPN --- STARTUP CONFIG NAME   : ${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}"
echo `date` "MY_FGVPN --- STARTUP VPN Subnet    : ${MY_STARTUP_VPNSubNet}"
echo `date` "MY_FGVPN --- STARTUP S3 Deploy URL : ${MY_STARTUP_S3_DEPLOY_URL}"

rm -rf /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}
mkdir /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}
mkdir /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}/boot
mkdir /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}/init

echo `date` "UserData script getting ${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME} init hierarchy from ${MY_FGVPN_S3_BUCKET} S3 bucket (from /deploy/init)"
echo `date` "THIS REQUIRES AN ASSIGNED EC2 ROLE"
aws s3 cp ${MY_STARTUP_S3_DEPLOY_URL}/init /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}/init --recursive
chmod -R u+x /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}/init/*.sh

echo `date` "UserData script building config vars sourcing script - /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}/conf-specs"
echo "export MY_FGVPN_CONFIG_NAME=${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}" > /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}/conf-specs
echo "export MY_FGVPN_VPNSubNet=${MY_STARTUP_VPNSubNet}" >> /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}/conf-specs
echo "export MY_FGVPN_S3_BUCKET=${MY_STARTUP_S3_BUCKET}" >> /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}/conf-specs
echo "export MY_FGVPN_S3_DEPLOY_URL=${MY_STARTUP_S3_DEPLOY_URL}" >> /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}/conf-specs
echo 'echo `date` "MY_FGVPN --- CONFIG NAME   : ${MY_FGVPN_CONFIG_NAME}"' >> /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}/conf-specs
echo 'echo `date` "MY_FGVPN --- VPN Subnet    : ${MY_FGVPN_VPNSubNet}"' >> /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}/conf-specs
echo 'echo `date` "MY_FGVPN --- S3 Deploy URL : ${MY_FGVPN_S3_DEPLOY_URL}"' >> /usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}/conf-specs

echo `date` "UserData script running ${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}-init.sh"
/usr/local/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}/init/${MY_STARTUP_CONFIG_NAME}-init.sh
echo `date` "UserData script finished"
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}



This is what the auto-setup script needs :

deploy/init

deploy/conf/config-name/

deploy/refresh/config-name/crl/







## Transfer Option 1 : Manual uploads



## Transfer Option 2 : CloudBerry Explorer for S3
