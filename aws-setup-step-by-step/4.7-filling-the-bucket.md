# 4.7-Filling the bucket - WIP

We'll need a specific hierarchy of folders and files in our S3 bucket, so that the bootstrap script \(enabling our OpenVPN server auto-configuration at startup\) find all the required elements to do its job.

**We'll first prepare this entire hierarchy locally, so that we can :**

* **easily check/edit/recheck** our file contents and the names of all files and sub-folders
* use both transfer options :
  * **manually transfer** our files with AWS S3 console
  * **use batch transfer/synching tools** like [CloudBerry Explorer for Amazon S3](../proposed-solution/tools.md#cloudberry-explorer-for-amazon-s3-free-version)

## Building the hierarchy locally

This is what the auto-setup script needs :

deploy/init

deploy/conf/config-name/

deploy/refresh/config-name/crl/







## Transfer Option 1 : Manual uploads



## Transfer Option 2 : CloudBerry Explorer for S3
