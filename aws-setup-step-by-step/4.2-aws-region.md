# 4.2-Choosing the AWS Region

Starting from here, let's choose an **AWS Region** as our playground, using the _Region menu_ near the top right corner of the console.

**The geographically closest to you is usually the best because it should give minimal latency** \(=delay\) **in network traffic** between you and your server.
{% endhint %}

_On the other hand, if most of your players are located far away from you **and** near each other, you may sometimes get better performance with a region near the players..._

For this demo I'll choose Stockholm \(called eu-north-1\), an AWS region which is "virgin territory" for me \(I have never used it before\), so that the screenshots are not too crowded by pre-existing AWS resources :

Before you create any kind of AWS "resource", always verify you are in the region you want...
{% endhint %}
