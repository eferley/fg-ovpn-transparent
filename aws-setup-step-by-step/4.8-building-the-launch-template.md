# 4.8-Building the Launch Template

## Manual launch vs. Launch template

In the AWS EC2 \(Elastic Cloud Computing\), **manually launching** a virtual machine is a **7-steps process**, during which you can or have to choose/specify **many options** :

![The interactive AWS EC2 &quot;Launch Instance&quot; process flow](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2840%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
We'll **facilitate the launch process** here by taking advantage of a relatively recent AWS feature : we'll _record our option choices_ in a "**Launch Template**", that we'll then use **to launch our server in a much quicker way**.
{% endhint %}

### Checking the "free elligible" Instance type in your AWs Region

_Going to the second step above_ : "_**Choose Instance Type**_" \(and then pressing **Cancel** to abort the process\) _**is a good idea** anyway_, because it will show you **what the "free elligible" Instance type is** for your **current AWS Region** : currently t2.micro or t3.micro.

For example, in Oregon :

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28101%29.png)

At step 2 you see that **the "Free tier elligible"** _**Instance type**_ **in Oregon is currently** _**t2.micro**_ :

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28163%29.png)

You can then click "**Cancel**" to exit the process.

## New _Launch Template_

In the **EC2 console**, let's click "**Launch Templates**" in the menu on the left side, and then "**Create Launch Template**" to get this form :

![Top of the Create Launch Template entry form](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28114%29.png)

For the first part :

* keep "_**What would you like to do ?**_" as "**Create a new template**"
* give a _**Launch template name** like my "my-fg-ovpn-201907" above_
* give a _**Template version description**_ as you whish
* the "_**Source template**_" stays **empty** since this is your first one.

## _**The "Launch template contents" section**_

![Launch template contents](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2870%29.png)

### AMI ID

The first choice is about the **AMI** = _**Amazon Machine Image**_. This is like the backup of a pre-built installation, that will be copied over to your own virtual machine to initialize it.

We use the _**Search for AMI**_ link and we'll select one from the "**Quick start**" _**AMI catalog**_ : the "_**Amazon Linux AMI YYYY.MM.v \(HVM\), SSD Volume Type**_" \(YYYY.MM.v = 2018.03.0 as of this writing\).

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28113%29.png)

Your choice will appear as an "**AMI ID**", which is **different for each region** : the same **"**_**Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0 \(HVM\), SSD Volume Type"**_ gives AMI ID = _**ami-8c169ef2**_ in Stockholm while at the same moment it gives _**ami-0bdfa1adc3878cd23**_ in London and _**ami-0f2176987ee50226e**_ in Oregon...

After confirming, the AMI ID is populated in the main form.

### Instance type

The second one is the **Instance type**, defining the size of virtual "core hardware" \(CPUs and RAM\).  There are [_**many instance types**_](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/), grouped in different families, of _**very different sizes and hourly cost**_ !

{% hint style="info" %}
**We'll use an instance type that is "free elligible" for the AWS region : generally** _**t2.micro**_

**\(**_**t3.micro**_ **is "free elligible" ONLY in regions where** _**t2.micro**_ **is not available\)**
{% endhint %}

Depending on your region, **one of these 2 types will be available as "free elligible"** :

* either _**t2.micro \(generally\)**_
* or the recent _**t3.micro in some regions without t2.micro**_

{% hint style="warning" %}
**In AWS regions where BOTH** _**t2.micro**_ **and** _**t3.micro**_ **are available :**

**ONLY** _**t2.micro**_ **is "free elligible"**

**So search for** _**t2.micro**_ **first in the list, and only if not found then choose** _**t3.micro**_
{% endhint %}

In **Stockholm as of July 2019**, _t2.micro_ is not available and _t3.micro_ is "free elligible", so **for this demo** **:** _**t3.micro**_ it will be and "free elligible" we'll remain :

![t3.micro is the &quot;free elligible&quot; instance type in Stockholm \(2019/07\)](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2813%29.png)

### Key pair name

[We only created 1 Key pair](4.5-creating-an-aws-key-pair.md), so this is an easy choice...

![Select your \(only\) Key pair name](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28176%29.png)

### Network type

**VPC !** For a new account, you don't even have access to the legacy "EC2 Classic" _- and you don't even want to know what it was..._

![VPC !](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28116%29.png)

### Security Groups

\*\*\*\*[**We created one**](4.6-creating-an-aws-security-group.md) just for our setup, so **let's select it** !

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28147%29.png)

_You can see that you can assign multiple security groups, so if you have different security groups for different kinds of network traffic authorization, you can cumulate them._

### Our choices so far, for this demo :

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28148%29.png)

_**As of July 2019, for the "free elligible" instance type, you would have t2.micro instead of t3.micro in most regions other than Stockholm.**_

## _Network Interfaces_, _Storage \(Volumes\)_ and _Instance tags_

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Step over these three blocks without touching them**
{% endhint %}

We'll use the default network interface and storage options, and we don't need tagging.

## _Advanced details_ : expand !!

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28171%29.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**We need to specify 2 options in this section :**

* _**IAM instance profile**_
* _**User data**_
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Don't touch to the other options !**

_**\(unless you're already outside the Free Tier AND you know what you're doing...\)**_
{% endhint %}

### IAM instance profile

Here you have to specify the **IAM Role** you [created earlier](4.1-creating-the-iam-role.md) :

![IAM instance profile : our IAM role created earlier](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28108%29.png)

### User data

Here you'll have to **copy/paste the contents of** [**your own "config.name"-userdata.sh**](4.7-filling-the-bucket.md#userdata-needs-you)\*\*\*\*

Here is ours **for this demo** \(_with our 2 edited lines highlighted_\) :

![Our customized userdata contents](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28143%29.png)

## Now, we can confirm our choices !

By clicking the blue "**Create launch template**" button at the bottom...

![Launch Template successfully created](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2863%29.png)

{% hint style="success" %}
**...We now have a** _**Launch Template**_ **ready to use !**
{% endhint %}
