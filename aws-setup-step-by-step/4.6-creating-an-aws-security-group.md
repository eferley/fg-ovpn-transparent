# 4.6-Creating an AWS Security Group

Back to the **AWS EC2 Console**, let's go to the "**Security Groups**" area...it's the **equivalent of a set of firewall rules** for your VPC. \(_the AWS infrastructure acts like a gigantic NAT/PAT router and firewall in front of your virtual servers in any AWS region/VPC/private network_\)

You will find a "_default VPC security group_" there, which authorizes all internal network traffic within your VPC for its members \("source" = every member of the security group itself\), and outbound traffic to anywhere \("destination" = 0.0.0.0/0\).

We'll create a _**specific**_ **Security Group** for our **OpenVPN + Fantasy Grounds** requirements \(and SSH access if you whish\), using the big blue "**Create Security Group**" button :

Give it a **Security group name** and a **Description**, your \(only\) default VPC should already be selected, and then let's have a look at the **Security group rules** panel.



#### **Outbound rules** tab :

![Authorized Outbound traffic : All / Anywhere](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2899%29.png)

This shows that the members \(virtual servers\) of that Security Group will be authorized to **send network packets of any kind, to anywhere** : no restriction, freedom, Yeah ! ðŸ†“ 

> **Tech blurb:**

> This is required, because your server will need to send packets :

> * from its own UDP 1194 port to you : unknown/volatile UDP port, probably unknown/volatile IP
>
> **The only "known" thingies here are on this server's side**



#### Inbound rules tab :

Using the "**Add Rule**" button, let's add 2 inbound rules, to authorize incoming network traffic, one using the "**Custom TCP rule**" type for FG, and the other the "**Custom UDP rule**" type for OpenVPN, like this :

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2859%29.png)

...and let's click the blue "**Create**" button.

{% hint style="success" %}
You now have a "working" dedicated **Security Group** for your FG-OpenVPN setup - _which also works if you are in a hotel room, etc..._
{% endhint %}

...but it's not perfect, so **let's modify it.**



#### You can always change the rules...

._**..even when they are currently in use by running servers**_ \(which is cool for tests, by the way\).

If we look at the Inbound rules for our newly created Security Group :

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2892%29.png)

We find some IPv6 rules there \(Source = ::/0\) that we don't want \(that's because we used the "Anywhere" destination or source, which is both IPv4 + IPv6\). So we'd like to **delete** these 2 lines.

Also maybe we would like to **add** an authorization rule for ourselves \(the current Public IPv4 of our home Internet access\) to access our server for interactive terminal connection through SSH \(=TCP 22\).

So let's click the "**Edit**" button on the **Inbound** tab...We can do all of that here :

![Red: delete rule, Orange : add rule, Blue : change some details](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28108%29.png)

Let's delete the 2 useless IPv6 rules, and add an SSH rule \(Type=SSH =&gt; TCP 22\) for "My IP"...

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2861%29.png)

As soon as you select "**My IP**" as a source or destination, it is replaced with your **current Public IPv4 as seen from the Internet**, which is why I blurred mine, _even though it's actually not a risk..._

Ok, after playing with rules for a moment, let's just clean up and finish with **our required Security Group Rules** for **FG + OpenVPN access from any IPv4 address**, then finally click the "**Save**" button :

{% hint style="info" %}
**You can always come back to change Security Group Inbound and Outbound rules**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Just don't delete the Security Group itself**, so that references to it **continue to be valid** \(see the _**Launch Template**_ further on\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
_\*\*\*\*_![](../.gitbook/assets/zeferby_dino_64%20%282%29.png) _**Ze Summary for our Security Group Rulez :**_

* **Outbound** : **ALL** Traffic **to ALL** IPv4
* **Inbound** : **TCP 1802 from ALL** IPv4 \(for FG\)
* **Inbound** : **UDP 1194 from ALL** IPv4 \(for OpenVPN\)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
IF you absolutely want to, you **can** restrict OpenVPN inbound rule to your own Public IPv4, **BUT then** you must **be prepared to update your OpenVPN inbound rule** :

* every time your **home public IPv4 address changes**
* every time you want to **host a game from any other place** \(hotel, etc...\)
{% endhint %}
