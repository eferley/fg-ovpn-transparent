# 4.3-Creating the S3 bucket

Let's create the storage space for our parameters and scripts : an **S3 bucket**.

**KEEP IT PRIVATE !!   KEEP IT PRIVATE !!   KEEP IT PRIVATE !!   KEEP IT PRIVATE !!**   
{% endhint %}

**Step 1 : Give it a name,** which must conform to some name restrictions, and be **unique** \(if warnings/errors show up, you'll need to change the name before continuing further\), check the **region.**

{% hint style="info" %}
**You can choose any name of your liking.**

The "**configuration name**" will have sub-folders named after it inside this bucket later on.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**KEEP IT PRIVATE !!   KEEP IT PRIVATE !!   KEEP IT PRIVATE !!   KEEP IT PRIVATE !!**   
{% endhint %}

Then hit "**Next**" \(to step 4\)...

A quick review of our choices, then click "**Create bucket**"...
