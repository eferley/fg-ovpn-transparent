# 4.3-Creating the S3 bucket

Let's create the storage space for ours parameters and scripts : an **S3 bucket**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**KEEP IT PRIVATE !!   KEEP IT PRIVATE !!   KEEP IT PRIVATE !!   KEEP IT PRIVATE !!**   
{% endhint %}

ðŸ‘† _Do you need me to repeat, or is that clear enough ?_ðŸ‘† 

So let's go to the **S3 console** \(**S3** is in the _**Storage**_ section on the main console listing all services\) :

You can guess ðŸ™„ : we'll click the blue "**Create bucket**" button...

**Step 1 : Give it a name,** which must conform to some name restrictions, and be **unique** \(if warnings/errors show up, you'll need to change the name before continuing further\), check the **region.**

{% hint style="info" %}
**You can choose any name of your liking.**

The "**configuration name**" will have sub-folders named after it inside this bucket later on.
{% endhint %}

Then hit "**Next**"...

ðŸ‘‡ _If you already forgot..._ ðŸ‘‡ 

{% hint style="danger" %}
**KEEP IT PRIVATE !!   KEEP IT PRIVATE !!   KEEP IT PRIVATE !!   KEEP IT PRIVATE !!**   
{% endhint %}

**Step 3 :** Let's **keep the security tight** and "**Block** _**all**_ **public access**" as is the default **!**

Then hit "**Next**"...

A quick review of our choices, then click "**Create bucket**"...
