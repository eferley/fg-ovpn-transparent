# Amazon Web Services

## Work In Progress





AWS provides cloud hosting services starting at the **IaaS** \(Infrastructure as a Service\) level.

That means you can create your virtual environment in the cloud hosted within AWS, exactly the way you want : networks, subnets, private or public, in multipe geographic locations, with servers of all sizes with or without Internet access, with network traffic filtering, etc...

"exactly the way you want" implies some measure of "do it yourself" and entails a not-so-easy learning curve to master the ins and outs of the AWS platform \(like other IaaS providers\).

AWS uses a "pay as you go" economic model, and provides a nice Free Tier.
