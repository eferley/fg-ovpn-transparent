# Step 6 : Launch time !

## ![](../.gitbook/assets/zeferby_dino_64%20%281%29.png) **Ready ? Steady ? Go !**

Using the EC2 Console we have this big blue "**Launch Instance**" _button+arrow_ waiting for us :

* on the "_**Dashboard**_"

* on the "_**Instances**_" console :

Let's **use our Launch Template** by using the **down-pointing arrow** on the right of the button here :

This gives you a form where you can select your **Launch Template** and its **version** :

You will then see all the choices that were recorded in the template, that you can override at launch time if you whish to :

Just check that your _**IAM instance profile**_ and _**User data**_ are populated by expanding the _**Advanced details**_ section, and click **Launch instance from template** at the bottom !

{% hint style="success" %}
**Your "instance" = virtual server has just been created and is starting !**
{% endhint %}

After closing the following "success" window, **go back to the "Instances" console** and select your "Instance" = your OpenVPN virtual server \(_by the way, don't bother trying to connect to the one below, it has long been terminated..._\) :

![First instance during startup](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28113%29.png)

After a few seconds, you'll see \(highlighted in red above\) its **public IPv4** and **automatically assigned DNS name** : this is where :

* **you** will **connect with OpenVPN**
* **your players** will **connect with Fantasy Grounds** when you're ready to host a game

During the initialization process, when the server goes through its auto-configuration, you'll see the field \(highlighted in pink above\) "**Source/dest. check**" changing from _**True**_ to _**False**_ : this is **expected and required** !

After 1 or 2 minutes, you should see the **Status Checks** field at the top showing " âœ… _**2/2 checks passed**_".

{% hint style="success" %}
**Your server is ready, patiently waiting for you to connect !**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Just take 1 second to hover your mouse over the **Public IPv4** and use the small button on the right to "_**copy to clipboard**_".
{% endhint %}
